# This is my wk1 homework for Hello Computer F21!
## Speech Synthesis

* For this assignment I made a speech synthesis that allows the user to type in words and the website will speak it out loud. 
* I created four buttons for different language choices(French, German, Japanese and Chinese).
* If type in any language displayed, and choose the same button, the website will speak that language.
* If type in a different language, the website will speak the type-in language with an accent of the "button" language.(Sometimes it doesn't work if the two languages are too different.)


Below are two screen shots of the website.
