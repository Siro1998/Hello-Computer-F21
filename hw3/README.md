# Hello Computer WK3 homework!
## Dialogflow Cyborgbot

### What I did

For this week's homework, I design a Cyborgbot by using Dialogflow. The user can communicate with the voice assistant and order/return/replace/repair an artificial body part. The flow is like this:
* Say hi to the Cyborgbot and it will ask for your name, which is your order account.
* After say your name, you will be asked for intention(order/return/replace/repair an artificial body part).
* After choose one action, you will be asked for the particular body part.
* Then you will be asked for what color you want the body part to be. And will get 3 possible response from the bot.
  * I love $color, great choice!
  * $color $bodypart, interesting choice!
  * Hmmm, not a big fan of $color $bodypart, but as long as you like it.
* And you will be told that your order will be delivered in 2 bussiness days. Goodbye!
* If you say something that the bot don't understand, it will give 3 possible response:
  * ?????? Maybe you should answer my question
  * Maybe I am too stupid, but I don't understand that.
  * Hmmmmm. I have no idea what you are saying.

### Some difficulties
* This is a very interesting assignment, I really enjoy designing the dialog. But at some part I really want to add some code. Like when choosing from the (order/return/replace/repair), I want the bot to give different responses instead of going to ask for color, like schedule a door-to-door techniqle help or a pick-up return. 
* I have the same trouble with David of testing my bot in the actions console.
