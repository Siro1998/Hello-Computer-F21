# This is my wk2 homework for Hello Computer F21!
## Speech Recognition

### What I did
* For this assignment I combine speech synthesis with speech recognition.
* The user can type in what they want to say and choose between French, English and Japanese for the computer to speak out loud. 
* Then the website will recognize the voice in chinese and display it on the website. 
(This is a very interesting part because I found that even I choose Chinese as the recognition languae, it can still detect some english. 
And sometimes it both speaks and recognizes in English, the result is still different from the type-in words.)
* After the speech recognition, a random gif about speech will be displayed.

### Website screenshot
* I use some css to make the layout looks a little bit better than last week's assignment

### Difficulties
* I think the biggest techniqle problem I got was the python server. I followed the class demo, but I kept getting a error said "no module named SimpleHTTPServer".
  And it turned out that I had Python3 and I should use a different command to run the server.

### Video demo
* Here is a video demo of my website. ("hhh" means lol or hahaha. Chinese send "hhh" a lot on WeChat.)
